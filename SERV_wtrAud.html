			<b>The water audit is a well established procedure that identifies productive uses and needless waste.</b> If one knows where water is used and lost, a saving plan of water can be planned. By conducting a water audit, one can track water usage and focus on activities that cause water loss and what that loss costs the utility. 
			<br><br>
			<b>The overall goal of a water audit should be to select and implement programmes that reduce water losses.</b> By conducting a water audit, an assessment of the capacity of total water produced and actual quantity water distributed is worked out. This will help to compute estimation of water losses in the system.  
			<br><br>
			Through our water audit services, we have guided the industry in deciding feasible options on reducing water usage, minimizing wastewater generation, and maximizing recovery. Our water audit provides greater water efficiency solutions and cost savings for meeting internal policies, complying with legal obligations or demonstrating a commitment to sustainability.
			<br><br>
			Water Audit is a systematic process of objectively obtaining a water balance by measuring the flow of water from the site of water withdrawal or treatment through the water distribution system and into areas where it is used and finally discharged.
			<br>
			The various steps followed during the course of a Detailed Water Audit are as follows: <br><br>

			•	A Preliminary Survey conducted before initiating the Detailed Water Audit.<br>
			•	This helps in identifying specific areas to be included in Scope of Work.
			ESPL customizes Detailed Water Audit agreement to efficiently meet client needs, schedules, and defined scope. <br>
			•	A detailed approach and methodology is followed. <br>
			•	State of the art instruments and portable water quality testing kits are used for measurement and monitoring. <br>
			•	Water Mapping and comprehensive water balances. Water quality assessments.  <br>
			•	Recommendations and identification of strategies. <br>
			•	Training programs organized for sensitizing the plant personnel, operators and employees raising awareness.<br>
