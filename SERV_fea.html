			<u>Feasibility Study</u>
		</h1>
		<br>
		<div class="content">
		<p>
			Our unique position in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector enables us to provide independent and unbiased advice to a variety of groups and organisations. We are able to undertake feasibility studies, strategic reviews and provide policy advice to individuals, community-based groups, businesses, local authorities and developers.
			<br><br>
			We've conducted heating surveys, renewable energy feasibility studies, energy efficiency assessments and other projects for a wide range of clients, including: schools; utilities; shops; offices; manufacturers; communal housing and community buildings.<br><br>
			<b><i>Key benefits of our feasibility study services</i></b><br><br>
			•	Independent, unbiased and authoritative heating system study and an investigative energy efficiency survey.<br>
			•	Technology-neutral investigation and report on the appropriateness and suitability of low/zero-carbon (renewable energy) heating and microgeneration systems.<br>
			•	Call to action - comprehensive findings and conclusions plus recommended solutions.<br><br>
			<b>Technologies considered in renewable energy feasibility studies</b><br>
			As part of our study, we look into the viability of a wide range of renewable energy technologies for both new-build and existing buildings and sites. These include:<br>
			•	Solar thermal.<br>
			•	Solar photovoltaic panels.<br>
			•	Wind turbines.<br>
			•	Ground source heating and cooling.<br>
			•	Air-source heating and cooling.<br>
			•	Biomass boilers and stoves.<br>
			•	Hydro.<br>
			•	Combined heat and power.<br>
			•	Combined cooling heat and power.<br><br>
			<b>What our feasibility studies service covers</b><br>
			For each technology we consider, our feasibility study includes:<br>
			•	Description of the technology.<br>
			•	Overview of the technical feasibility.<br>
			•	Potential advantages and disadvantages of installing the technology.<br>
			•	Possible constraints.<br>
			•	Estimated cost of installation.<br>
			•	Financial incentives <br>
			•	Estimated return on investment.<br>
			•	CO2 savings over time.<br>
			•	Recommendations regarding the most suitable technologies.<br>
			•	Recommendations on improvements to building energy efficiency.<br>
			•	Next steps<br>
			As an additional service, we can also help you identify potential suppliers and installers, and assist in the tendering and selection process.<br><br>
			<b>Building the business case for investment </b><br>
			Although some renewable and energy efficiency opportunities can be implemented through operational change, and don't require any capital investment, others require capital investment. We have excellent experience of helping organisations identify and quantify energy efficiency opportunities and then build the business case to secure the required investment and get the opportunities adopted:<br>
			•	Understanding what the decision makers are looking for.<br>
			•	Obtaining forward estimates of energy prices.<br>
			•	Identifying any additional benefits.<br>
			•	Quantifying any implementation costs.<br>
			•	Considering the financing.<br>
			•	Raising and discussing any possible risks.<br>
			•	Considering the various financial appraisal methods - for example: Simple Payback Period (SPP); Discounted Cash Flow (DCF); Internal Rate of Return; and Life Cycle Costing.<br>
			<b>We can help you with any stage in the process.</b>
